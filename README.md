# Youtube-Anti-Pause
Blocks YouTube from showing the **"Video paused. Continue watching?"** popup and overlay — permanently.

##Installation

1. Install a userscript manager extension:  
   - [Violentmonkey (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)  
   - [Tampermonkey (Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari)](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)  

2. Open your extension dashboard.  

3. Create a **new userscript**.  

4. Copy the raw code from:  
   YouTube Anti Pause-1.0.user.js

5. Paste it into the editor, then **Save**.  

Done! YouTube will no longer pause your videos with that annoying prompt.

## Notes
- Works on desktop browsers with Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey.  
- Script is lightweight and doesn’t interfere with video playback or other features.  
- Open an issue if you run into problems or want improvements.
